### Chapter 2: Object-Oriented Programming

- ### 2.1 Goals, Principles and Patterns

    - [ ] 2.1.1 Object-Oriented Design Goals
        - The main actors in the object-oriented paradigm are called objects.
        - Each object is an instance of a class.
        - Each class presents to the outside world a concise and consistent view of the objects that are instances of this class.
        - Software implementations should achieve robustness, adaptability, and reusability:
            - Robustness
                - Every good programmer wants to develop software that is correct, which means taht a program produces the right output for all the anticipated inputs in the program's application. In addition, we want software to be robust, that is, capable of handling unexpected inputs that are not explictly defined for its application. For example, if a program is expecting a positive integer (perhaps representing the price of an item) and instead is given a negative integer, then the program should be able to recover gracefully from this error.
            - Adaptability
                - Modern software applications, such as Web browsers and Internet search engines, typically involve large programs that are used for many years. Software, there- fore, needs to be able to evolve over time in response to changing conditions in its environment. Thus, another important goal of quality software is that it achieves adaptability (also called evolvability). Related to this concept is portability, which is the ability of software to run with minimal change on different hardware and operating system platforms. An advantage of writing software in Python is the portability provided by the language itself.
            - Reusability
                - For example the front-end and back-end frameworks for web development
