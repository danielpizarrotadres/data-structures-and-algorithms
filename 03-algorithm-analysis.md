### Chapter 3: Algorithm Analysis

In this book, we are interested in the design of “good” data structures and algorithms. Simply put, a data structure is a systematic way of organizing and accessing data, and an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for performing some task in a finite amount of time. These concepts are central to computing, but to be able to classify some data structure and algorithms as “good”, we must have precise ways of analyzing them.
