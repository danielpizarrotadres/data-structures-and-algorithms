### Chapter 4: Recursion

One way to describe repetition within a computer program is the use of loops, such as Python's while-loop and for-loop constructs described in Section 1.4.2. An entirely different way to achieve repetition is through a process known as recursion.

Recursion is a technique by which a function makes one or more calls to itself during execution, or by which a data structure relies upon smaller instances of the very same type of structure in its representation.
