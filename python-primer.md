- ### 1.1 Python Overview

    - [ ] 1.1.1 The Python Interpreter
        - Python is formally an interpreted lenguage.
        - Commands are executed through a piece of software known as the Python interpreted.
        - The interpreter receives a command, evaluates that command, and reports the result of the command.
        - While the interpreter can be used interactively (especially when debugging), a programmer typically defines a series of commands in advance and saves those commands in a lain text file known a source code or a script.
        - For Python, source code is convencionally stored in a file name with the .py suffix (e.g., demo.py).
