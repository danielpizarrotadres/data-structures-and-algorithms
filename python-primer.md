### Chapter 1: Python Primer

- ### 1.1 Python Overview

    - [ ] 1.1.1 The Python Interpreter
        - Python is formally an interpreted lenguage.
        - Commands are executed through a piece of software known as the Python interpreted.
        - The interpreter receives a command, evaluates that command, and reports the result of the command.
        - While the interpreter can be used interactively (especially when debugging), a programmer typically defines a series of commands in advance and saves those commands in a lain text file known a source code or a script.
        - For Python, source code is convencionally stored in a file name with the .py suffix (e.g., demo.py).

- ### 1.2 Objects in Python
        
    - [ ] Identifiers, Objects and the Assignment Statement
        - The most important of all Python command is an assignment statement
        - e.g., temperature = 98.6
        - This command establishes temperature as an identifier andthen associates it with the object expressed on the right-hand side of the equal sign, in this case a floating-point object with value 98.6.
        - A python identifier (also called variable or constant in other interpreted programming lenguages) is most similar to a reference variable in java or a pointer variable in C++.
        - Each identifier is implicity associated with the memory address of the object (in the e.g., 98.6 floating-point object) to which it refers.
        - Unlike Java and C++, Python is dynamically typed lenguage because there is no necessary that each idenifier has a particular data type
